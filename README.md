**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2020b. Compatible with R2020b and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach the fundamental concepts of vectors, such as vector magnitude and addition.

<a name="H_F00D98E4"></a>
## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. [<samp>VectorBasics</samp>](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Vector-Arithmetic&project=VectorArithmetic.prj&file=VectorBasics.mlx) is an interactive lesson that teaches the basics of individual vectors, such as vector components, vector magnitude, and vector orientation. [<samp>VectorArithmetic</samp>](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Vector-Arithmetic&project=VectorArithmetic.prj&file=VectorArithmetic.mlx) is an interactive lesson that teaches vector arithmetic. Vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product are discussed. These methods are motivated by an application: calculating the orientation of a cell phone using the built-in accelerometer and magnetometer. Throughout the module, students apply the mathematical techniques to computing meaningful values, such as pitch and yaw.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/EndIcon.png" width="19" alt="EndIcon.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes knowledge of high school algebra and trigonometry. It does not assume any MATLAB knowledge. All scripts are intended to be used in Hidden Code mode.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the  [<img src="Images/OpenInMO.png" width="136" alt="OpenInMO.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Vector-Arithmetic&project=VectorArithmetic.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double-click on [VectorArithmetic.prj](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Vector-Arithmetic&project=VectorArithmetic.prj). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products ([listed below](#H_E850B4FF)) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add-On Explorer. To install an add-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/AddOnsIcon.png" width="16" alt="AddOnsIcon.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**.
